# emonGLCD V1


A general purpose wireless graphical LCD display unit. Powered by an Atmega328 with an Arduino bootloader.

The emonGLCD is designed to drive a 128x64 GLCD display based on the ST7565 driver. The board has a built in HopeRF RFM12B wireless module to receive data from the emonTx energy monitoring node or an emonBase (Nanode-RF web-connected basestation) which in turn could be pulled aggregated data from a web-sever to be displayed.

The emonGLCD has an on-board temperate sensor, light sensor and two tri-color ambient indicator LED's.

Based on JeeLabs.org design.
